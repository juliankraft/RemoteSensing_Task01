	abstract = {High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or {GPS}) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed ‘Structure-from-Motion’ ({SfM}). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the {SfM} method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models ({DEMs}) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an {SfM}-derived {DEM} is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using {SfM} even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of {SfM} are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The {SfM} technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate {SfM} is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography.},

	abstract = {Accurate, precise and rapid acquisition of topographic data is fundamental to many sub-disciplines of physical geography. Technological developments over the past few decades have made fully distributed data sets of centimetric resolution and accuracy commonplace, yet the emergence of Structure from Motion ({SfM}) with Multi-View Stereo ({MVS}) in recent years has revolutionised three-dimensional topographic surveys in physical geography by democratising data collection and processing. {SfM}-{MVS} originates from the fields of computer vision and photogrammetry, requires minimal expensive equipment or specialist expertise and, under certain conditions, can produce point clouds of comparable quality to existing survey methods (e.g. Terrestrial Laser Scanning). Consequently, applications of {SfM}-{MVS} in physical geography have multiplied rapidly. There are many practical options available to physical geographers when planning a {SfM}-{MVS} survey (e.g. platforms, cameras, software), yet, many {SfM}-{MVS} end-users are uncertain as to the errors associated with each choice and, perhaps most fundamentally, the processes actually taking place as part of the {SfM}-{MVS} workflow. This paper details the typical workflow applied by {SfM}-{MVS} software packages, reviews practical details of implementing {SfM}-{MVS}, combines existing validation studies to assess practically achievable data quality and reviews the range of applications of {SfM}-{MVS} in physical geography. The flexibility of the {SfM}-{MVS} approach complicates attempts to validate {SfM}-{MVS} robustly as each individual validation study will use a different approach (e.g. platform, camera, georeferencing method, etc.). We highlight the need for greater transparency in {SfM}-{MVS} processing and enhanced ability to adjust parameters that determine survey quality. Looking forwards, future prospects of {SfM}-{MVS} in physical geography are identified through discussion of more recent developments in the fields of image analysis and computer vision.},
